# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** Given an input payload and bad-byte policy, byvalver must produce functionally equivalent shellcode that is verifiably free of forbidden bytes.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Verification Automation and Reporting
