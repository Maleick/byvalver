# Requirements Archive: v4.4 Equivalence Reliability

**Archived:** 2026-02-26  
**Closure mode:** Shipped with accepted gaps

For current active requirements, create a fresh `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` in the next milestone.

## Requirement Outcomes

All v4.4 requirements are now closed for this milestone with one of:
- **Validated:** implemented and verified in v4.4
- **Deferred:** accepted gap, explicitly moved to next milestone scope

### Release Reliability (Validated)

- [x] **REL-04**: Deterministic `verify-equivalence` outcomes for representative x86/x64/arm fixtures.
- [x] **REL-05**: Release artifacts identify failing architecture/fixture/check and include deterministic rerun commands.
- [x] **REL-06**: Local `make release-gate` and CI release-gate enforce the same required checks and status logic.

### ARM64 Strategy Expansion (Deferred)

- [x] **ARM64-01**: ARM64 arithmetic rewrite paths preserve semantic behavior under bad-byte constraints.  
  Outcome: Deferred to next milestone (not delivered in v4.4).
- [x] **ARM64-02**: ARM64 load/store displacement rewrites preserve addressing behavior.  
  Outcome: Deferred to next milestone (not delivered in v4.4).
- [x] **ARM64-03**: Deterministic ARM64 representative fixtures integrated into verification workflows.  
  Outcome: Deferred to next milestone (not delivered in v4.4).

### Architecture Assist (Deferred)

- [x] **ARCH-01**: Scored architecture mismatch diagnostics with suggested fallback commands.  
  Outcome: Deferred to next milestone (not delivered in v4.4).
- [x] **ARCH-02**: Non-destructive architecture assist flow (`--dry-run` + guidance) documented and validated.  
  Outcome: Deferred to next milestone (not delivered in v4.4).
- [x] **ARCH-03**: Verification artifacts include architecture-assist context for failure triage.  
  Outcome: Deferred to next milestone (not delivered in v4.4).

## Final Traceability

| Requirement | Final v4.4 Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| REL-04 | Validated | Delivered in Phase 6 |
| REL-05 | Validated | Delivered in Phase 6 |
| REL-06 | Validated | Delivered in Phase 6 |
| ARM64-01 | Deferred | Gap accepted; carry to next milestone |
| ARM64-02 | Deferred | Gap accepted; carry to next milestone |
| ARM64-03 | Deferred | Gap accepted; carry to next milestone |
| ARCH-01 | Deferred | Gap accepted; carry to next milestone |
| ARCH-02 | Deferred | Gap accepted; carry to next milestone |
| ARCH-03 | Deferred | Gap accepted; carry to next milestone |
