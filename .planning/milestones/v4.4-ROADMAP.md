# Milestone v4.4: Equivalence Reliability

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-26 (with accepted gaps)  
**Phases:** 6-8  
**Plan completion:** 3/8 plans delivered  
**Task completion:** 9 tasks delivered

## Overview

Milestone v4.4 focused on restoring deterministic release-gate confidence and
making equivalence failures immediately actionable. Phase 6 was fully delivered
and verified. Phase 7 (ARM64 strategy expansion) and Phase 8 (architecture assist)
were accepted as deferred gaps and will be re-scoped into the next milestone.

## Phase Details

### Phase 6: Equivalence Gate Determinism and Triage

**Goal:** Make representative equivalence checks deterministic and release-gate failures immediately actionable.  
**Depends on:** Phase 5  
**Requirements:** REL-04, REL-05, REL-06  
**Plans:** 3

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Stabilize representative equivalence harness inputs, ordering, and status semantics.
- [x] 06-02: Standardize release-gate summary schema and deterministic rerun guidance outputs.
- [x] 06-03: Resolve representative equivalence blockers and lock host/Docker parity behavior.

Outcome:
- Deterministic `verify-equivalence` across representative x86/x64/arm fixtures.
- Tuple-first release diagnostics with rerun metadata in artifacts and CI summary.
- Local and CI release-gate paths aligned on one required-check contract.

### Phase 7: ARM64 Core Strategy Expansion (Deferred)

**Goal:** Expand ARM64 strategy coverage for arithmetic/load-store families.  
**Depends on:** Phase 6  
**Requirements:** ARM64-01, ARM64-02, ARM64-03  
**Plans:** 3 (not executed in v4.4)

Status:
- Deferred as accepted milestone gap.
- To be re-planned in the next milestone.

### Phase 8: Architecture Assist and Operator Guidance (Deferred)

**Goal:** Reduce wrong-architecture mutation attempts with scored recommendations.  
**Depends on:** Phase 7  
**Requirements:** ARCH-01, ARCH-02, ARCH-03  
**Plans:** 2 (not executed in v4.4)

Status:
- Deferred as accepted milestone gap.
- To be re-planned in the next milestone.

## Milestone Summary

**Key decisions:**
- Close v4.4 after Phase 6 delivery and carry forward Phase 7/8 as explicit debt.
- Preserve strict release-blocking semantics for required parity/equivalence mismatches.

**Issues resolved:**
- Representative equivalence false/unstable failures in release-gate flow.
- Inconsistent local vs CI gate semantics.

**Issues deferred:**
- ARM64 core strategy expansion (`ARM64-01/02/03`).
- Architecture assist and guidance integration (`ARCH-01/02/03`).

**Technical debt accepted:**
- v4.4 milestone requirements are only partially satisfied (3/9).
- Gap closure requires a fresh milestone planning cycle.
