# Milestone v4.4: Equivalence Reliability Audit

**Milestone Goal:** Restore deterministic release-gate confidence, expand practical ARM64 coverage, and reduce architecture-selection error loops.
**Audited:** 2026-02-26T17:09:39Z
**Status:** gaps_found

## Scope

Milestone v4.4 phases (from ROADMAP):
- Phase 6: Equivalence Gate Determinism and Triage
- Phase 7: ARM64 Core Strategy Expansion
- Phase 8: Architecture Assist and Operator Guidance

## Phase Verification Rollup

| Phase | Verification File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | `.planning/phases/06-equivalence-gate-determinism-and-triage/06-VERIFICATION.md` | passed | REL-04/05/06 verified and completed. |
| 7 | missing | unverified | No phase directory/plans/summaries/verifications yet. |
| 8 | missing | unverified | No phase directory/plans/summaries/verifications yet. |

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

Sources cross-checked:
1. `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` traceability table
2. Phase `VERIFICATION.md` requirements coverage sections
3. Phase `SUMMARY.md` frontmatter `requirements-completed`

| Requirement | Assigned Phase | REQUIREMENTS.md | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY frontmatter | Final Status |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| REL-04 | 6 | `[x]` Complete | passed in Phase 6 | listed (`06-01`, `06-03`) | satisfied |
| REL-05 | 6 | `[x]` Complete | passed in Phase 6 | listed (`06-02`) | satisfied |
| REL-06 | 6 | `[x]` Complete | passed in Phase 6 | listed (`06-03`) | satisfied |
| ARM64-01 | 7 | `[ ]` Pending | missing | missing | orphaned (unsatisfied) |
| ARM64-02 | 7 | `[ ]` Pending | missing | missing | orphaned (unsatisfied) |
| ARM64-03 | 7 | `[ ]` Pending | missing | missing | orphaned (unsatisfied) |
| ARCH-01 | 8 | `[ ]` Pending | missing | missing | orphaned (unsatisfied) |
| ARCH-02 | 8 | `[ ]` Pending | missing | missing | orphaned (unsatisfied) |
| ARCH-03 | 8 | `[ ]` Pending | missing | missing | orphaned (unsatisfied) |

**Coverage:** 3/9 satisfied

FAIL gate applied: unsatisfied requirements detected, so milestone audit status is `gaps_found`.

## Cross-Phase Integration Assessment

- Phase 6 integration is internally verified (artifact/key-link checks passed).
- Milestone-level integration is incomplete because Phase 7 and Phase 8 contracts are not implemented yet.

## End-to-End Flow Assessment

- Release reliability flow (Phase 6 scope): passing and deterministic.
- ARM64 expansion flow: blocked pending Phase 7 implementation.
- Architecture-assist flow: blocked pending Phase 8 implementation.

## Conclusion

Milestone v4.4 is **not ready for completion**. Phase 6 is complete, but milestone definition-of-done requires additional requirements delivered by Phases 7 and 8.

Recommended routing:
- Plan and execute gap closure work before milestone completion.
