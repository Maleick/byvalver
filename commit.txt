feat: Add advanced denullification strategies for modern shellcode patterns

- Implement Advanced Hash-Based API Resolution Strategy (priority 96)
  Handles sophisticated hash algorithms in modern shellcode for API resolution,
  including complex combinations of ROR/ROL operations with XOR, 16-bit hashes,
  and multi-stage hash resolution patterns that were previously not handled.

- Implement Multi-Stage PEB Traversal Strategy (priority 97)
  Handles complex PEB (Process Environment Block) traversal sequences that load
  multiple DLLs sequentially (e.g., kernel32, user32, ws2_32) before resolving
  APIs from different modules in a single shellcode.

- Implement Stack-Based Structure Construction Strategy (priority 94)
  Constructs complex Windows structures (like STARTUPINFO, PROCESS_INFORMATION,
  sockaddr_in, etc.) directly on the stack during runtime while eliminating any
  null bytes that may appear in immediate values or displacement fields.

- Enhance SALC Strategy to handle SALC+REP STOSB patterns (priority 93)
  Enhanced to manage complex SALC (Set AL on Carry) + REP STOSB patterns used
  for efficient null-filled buffer initialization, including MOV ECX/EDI with
  immediate values containing nulls.

- Enhance Stack String Construction Strategy (priority 95)
  Enhanced to handle more complex patterns including MOV operations to stack
  addresses, SUB operations for stack allocation, and CALL operations that
  might use constructed strings, consolidating with existing functionality.

- Update strategy documentation in DENULL_STRATS.md with new strategies
- Update README.md to reflect new advanced transformation capabilities
- All strategies properly integrated into registry with appropriate priorities
- Comprehensive testing performed with shellcode samples

These enhancements significantly improve BYVALVER's ability to handle modern
shellcode patterns while maintaining complete functional equivalence and
robust null-byte elimination.
