FIX: Move DEBUG_LOG macro definition to central header file

## Summary

This commit fixes an issue where the DEBUG_LOG macro was only defined in src/core.c, making it unavailable to other compilation units such as src/utils.c. The macro has been moved to src/core.h to ensure consistent availability across the codebase.

## Problem

- DEBUG_LOG macro was defined in src/core.c but used in src/utils.c after adding debug statements
- This caused compilation errors with "implicit declaration of function 'DEBUG_LOG'" and undefined references during linking
- Multiple other files also had local DEBUG_LOG definitions, creating inconsistencies

## Solution

- Moved the DEBUG_LOG definition from src/core.c to src/core.h
- Added necessary #include <stdio.h> to src/core.h for fprintf function
- Removed duplicate DEBUG_LOG definitions from other files (getpc_strategies.c, strategy_registry.c, obfuscation_strategy_registry.c)
- Maintained conditional compilation with #ifdef DEBUG/#else blocks to ensure debug builds work properly

## Changes

- src/core.h: Added DEBUG_LOG macro definition with conditional compilation
- src/core.c: Removed DEBUG_LOG macro definition (now centralized in header)
- src/utils.c: Now properly accesses DEBUG_LOG through core.h
- src/getpc_strategies.c: Removed local DEBUG_LOG definition
- src/strategy_registry.c: Removed local DEBUG_LOG definition
- src/obfuscation_strategy_registry.c: Removed local DEBUG_LOG definition

## Verification

- Build succeeds with make debug
- Debug logs work properly when DEBUG flag is enabled
- No compilation warnings or linker errors
- Null-byte elimination functionality remains unchanged
