- Statistics and progress tracking components
- Input/output directory management

### 6. Biphasic Processing Architecture Diagram
**Purpose**: Sequential diagram of the two-pass processing system
**Key Elements**:
- Pass 1: Obfuscation and complexification
- Pass 2: Null-byte elimination
- Data flow between passes
- Strategy application for each pass
