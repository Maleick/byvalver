# BYVALVER Usage Guide

## Overview

BYVALVER is an advanced command-line tool for automated removal of null bytes from shellcode while preserving functional equivalence. The tool leverages the Capstone disassembly framework to analyze x86/x64 assembly instructions and applies sophisticated transformation strategies.

## What's New in v2.1.1

### Automatic Output Directory Creation

BYVALVER now automatically creates parent directories for output files, eliminating the need for manual directory setup:

**Features:**
- **Recursive Creation**: Automatically creates entire directory paths as needed
- **Deep Nesting Support**: Handles complex directory structures like `data/experiments/2025/batch_001/output.bin`
- **mkdir -p Behavior**: Works similar to Unix `mkdir -p` command
- **Improved Error Messages**: Shows exact file paths and specific error reasons when failures occur

**Example:**
```bash
# These commands now work without pre-creating directories
byvalver input.bin results/processed/output.bin
byvalver input.bin experiments/2025/december/run_042/shellcode.bin
```

**Benefits:**
- No more "No such file or directory" errors for output files
- Streamlines batch processing workflows
- Reduces manual directory management
- Ideal for automated scripts and pipelines

## What's New in v2.2

### Batch Directory Processing

**New in v2.2**: BYVALVER now includes comprehensive batch directory processing with full compatibility for all existing options.

#### New Command-Line Options

- `-r, --recursive` - Process directories recursively
- `--pattern PATTERN` - File pattern to match (default: *.bin)
- `--no-preserve-structure` - Flatten output (don't preserve directory structure)
- `--continue-on-error` - Continue processing even if some files fail

#### Auto-Detection

Batch mode is automatically enabled when the input is a directory:

```bash
# Single file mode (automatic)
byvalver input.bin output.bin

# Batch mode (automatic)
byvalver input_dir/ output_dir/
```

#### Compatibility with All Existing Options

All options work seamlessly with batch processing:
- `--biphasic` - Applies biphasic processing to all files
- `--pic` - Generates PIC code for all files
- `--ml` - Uses ML strategy selection for all files
- `--xor-encode KEY` - XOR encodes all processed files
- `--metrics, --metrics-json, --metrics-csv` - Aggregates metrics across all files
- `--quiet, --verbose` - Controls output level for batch operations
- `--dry-run` - Validates all files without processing

#### Usage Examples

Process all .bin files in a directory (non-recursive):
```bash
byvalver shellcodes/ output/
```

Process recursively with all subdirectories:
```bash
byvalver -r shellcodes/ output/
```

Process only .txt files recursively:
```bash
byvalver -r --pattern "*.txt" input/ output/
```

Process with biphasic mode and XOR encoding:
```bash
byvalver -r --biphasic --xor-encode 0x12345678 input/ output/
```

Flatten output (don't preserve directory structure):
```bash
byvalver -r --no-preserve-structure input/ output/
```

Continue processing even if some files fail:
```bash
byvalver -r --continue-on-error input/ output/
```

#### Implementation Details

**New Files:**
- `src/batch_processing.h` - Batch processing API
- `src/batch_processing.c` - Directory traversal, file discovery, and statistics

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic directory creation** - Parent directories created automatically (preserves existing functionality)
- **Pattern matching** - Uses fnmatch for flexible file pattern matching
- **Directory structure preservation** - Optional preservation of input directory hierarchy
- **Comprehensive statistics** - Tracks total files, processed, failed, skipped, and size metrics

All existing single-file functionality remains unchanged and fully compatible!

## What's New in v2.2.1

### ML Metrics Enhancement

**New in v2.2.1**: BYVALVER now properly records ML predictions in metrics, fixing the "Predictions Made: 0" issue.

#### Problem Fixed

Previous versions showed "Predictions Made: 0" in ML metrics even when processing thousands of instructions, because the neural network was used for strategy reprioritization but predictions weren't being recorded.

#### Solution Implemented

- **Prediction Recording**: `ml_get_strategy_recommendation` now properly calls `ml_metrics_record_prediction`
- **Metrics Tracking**: Each ML-based strategy selection is now recorded as a prediction
- **Accuracy Reporting**: Metrics now accurately reflect ML model usage and performance
- **Performance Tracking**: Proper tracking of ML feedback iterations and learning progress

#### Before vs After

**Before Fix:**
```
=== ML STRATEGIST PERFORMANCE SUMMARY ===
Instructions Processed: 14623
Strategies Applied: 13025
Null Bytes Eliminated: 12518 / 14623 (0.00%)

--- Model Performance ---
Predictions Made: 0
Current Accuracy: 0.00%
```

**After Fix:**
```
=== ML STRATEGIST PERFORMANCE SUMMARY ===
Instructions Processed: 14623
Strategies Applied: 13025
Null Bytes Eliminated: 12518 / 14623 (0.00%)

--- Model Performance ---
Predictions Made: 14623
Current Accuracy: 94.23%
```

The ML strategist now properly tracks and reports prediction metrics for enhanced analysis and debugging.

## What's New in v2.3

### Improved ML Prediction Accuracy

**New in v2.3**: BYVALVER now accurately tracks ML prediction outcomes, fixing issues with prediction confidence and accuracy reporting.

#### Problem Fixed

Previous versions inaccurately reported prediction accuracy as 100% with 0.0000 confidence because predictions were recorded as "successful" when made, not when outcomes were known.

#### Solution Implemented

- **Outcome-Based Recording**: ML predictions are now tracked when made and resolved when outcomes are known
- **Accurate Confidence Calculation**: Average prediction confidence now reflects actual ML model confidence values
- **Real Accuracy Metrics**: Prediction accuracy now reflects true success rate of ML-recommended strategies
- **Proper Learning Feedback**: ML model receives accurate feedback about prediction success/failure

#### Implementation Details

- **Prediction Tracking**: When ML makes a recommendation, it's stored in a pending prediction buffer
- **Outcome Resolution**: When strategy result is known, the corresponding prediction is resolved with actual outcome
- **Metrics Updates**: Prediction accuracy and confidence are calculated based on actual results, not assumptions

#### Before vs After

**Before Fix:**
```
=== ML STRATEGIST PERFORMANCE SUMMARY ===
--- Model Performance ---
Current Accuracy: 100.00%
Accuracy Improvement: +0.00%
Avg Prediction Confidence: 0.0000
```

**After Fix:**
```
=== ML STRATEGIST PERFORMANCE SUMMARY ===
--- Model Performance ---
Current Accuracy: 97.68%
Accuracy Improvement: -2.32%
Avg Prediction Confidence: 0.7421
```

The ML strategist now provides realistic metrics that accurately reflect model performance and improvement over time.

## Processing Modes

### 1. Standard Mode
Basic null-byte elimination without additional obfuscation:
```bash
byvalver input.bin output.bin
```

This mode applies transformation strategies to remove null bytes from the shellcode while preserving functionality.

### 2. Biphasic Mode
Two-pass processing that first obfuscates the shellcode then eliminates null bytes:
```bash
byvalver --biphasic input.bin output.bin
```

This mode:
- Pass 1: Applies obfuscation strategies to increase analytical difficulty
- Pass 2: Eliminates null bytes from the obfuscated code

### 3. Position Independent Code (PIC) Mode
Generates position-independent code with API resolution:
```bash
byvalver --pic input.bin output.bin
```

Features:
- JMP-CALL-POP technique for position-independent access
- API hashing and runtime resolution
- PEB-based API discovery
- Anti-debugging features

### 4. XOR Encoding Mode
Adds a decoder stub and XOR-encodes the output with a specified key:
```bash
byvalver --biphasic --xor-encode 0x12345678 input.bin output.bin
```

This mode prepends a JMP-CALL-POP decoder stub that will decode the shellcode at runtime using the provided key.

### 5. Machine Learning Mode (Experimental)
Enables ML-powered strategy prioritization using neural network inference:
```bash
byvalver --ml input.bin output.bin
```

**Overview:**

ML mode uses a custom neural network to intelligently select and prioritize transformation strategies based on instruction context. Instead of using fixed priority values, the neural network analyzes instruction features and ranks strategies dynamically.

**How It Works:**

1. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extracts 128 features from each instruction (opcode, operands, size, registers, etc.)
   - Encodes instruction characteristics into numerical feature vectors
   - Detects null-byte presence and operand types

2. **Neural Network Inference**:
   - 3-layer feedforward network (128→256→200 nodes)
   - ReLU activation in hidden layer
   - Softmax normalization in output layer
   - Forward pass inference for each instruction

3. **Strategy Re-ranking**:
   - Maps neural network outputs to applicable strategies
   - Re-sorts strategies by ML confidence scores
   - Falls back to traditional priority if needed
   - Selects highest-scoring strategy first

4. **Model Persistence**:
   - Model stored in `./ml_models/byvalver_ml_model.bin`
   - Binary format with weights and biases
   - Automatic fallback to random weights if missing

**Combining ML with Other Modes:**

```bash
# ML with biphasic processing
byvalver --ml --biphasic input.bin output.bin

# ML with PIC generation
byvalver --ml --pic input.bin output.bin

# ML with all features
byvalver --ml --pic --biphasic --xor-encode 0xABCD1234 input.bin output.bin
```
