/*
 * BYVALVER - Overlapping Instruction Obfuscation (Priority 84)
 *
 * Creates instruction sequences where bytes decode differently based on entry point.
 * STUB IMPLEMENTATION - Requires sophisticated instruction alignment.
 *
 * Future implementation will:
 * - Create multi-interpretation byte sequences
 * - Use conditional jumps to select interpretation
 * - Confuse linear disassemblers
 * - Support recursive descent disassembly evasion
